									<h2>Regression Analysis of Online Purchase Intention</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Demonstrated prowess in predictive analytics by developing a robust model to forecast online purchasing behavior with an impressive accuracy rate of 88%. This innovative solution empowered e-commerce enterprises to identify and capitalize on revenue-generating opportunities, showcasing our ability to deliver tangible business outcomes through data-driven insights.</p>
								<p><b>Case Thesis:</b> What attributes within the captured Google Analytics metrics can contribute to the possibility of a customer purchasing an item?</p>
								The null and alternative hypotheses were as follows:
										<br/><i>Null hypothesis-</i>The logistic regression model shows that the predictor variable of “Revenue” and the explanatory variables do not have a statistically significant relationship.
										<br/><i>Alternative hypothesis-</i>The logistic regression model shows a statistically significant relationship between the predictor variable “Revenue” and explanatory variables.
										<br/><br/>				
										<b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> To reject the null hypothesis, the optimized logistic regression model accuracy score of greater than 80% and statistically significant attributes were noted. A p-value of less than 0.05 marked statistical significance. To fail to reject the hypothesis, the model would have a p-value greater than 0.05, which meant there was no statistically significant relationship between the target and explanatory variables.
										<br/><br/>With the increasing rise of online purchasing in current society, using Google Analytics within e-commerce offered insights to increase profitability. The metrics captured the user behavior within the website. These included the number of times each page was visited, the time duration in seconds a user interacted with the page, or an item was purchased i.e., revenue was obtained. Logistic Regression could identify if any of these metrics provided a significant relationship between whether an item was purchased or not. This would be an ideal method for narrowing the scope of the metrics to be used for strategic marketing. </p>
									<ul>
										
										<li>Data Analysis Process</li>
											<p><i>The initial regression model utilized the target variable of “Revenue” along with all the explanatory variables within the prepared dataset. The initial regression model showed the various evaluation metrics identifying the goodness of fit measurement. The model revealed a LLR p-value of 0.0 deeming the overall model statistically significant and a pseudo r-squared measure of 30.34%.</i></p>
										<img src="images/intiallogit.png" alt="Logit Initial">
											<p>The train_test_split was generated with a 70:30 ratio. Seventy percent of the dataset went to training, with thirty percent allocated to test data. The logistic regression score had an ideal success of 88.13%. The regression model was summarized with the following prediction results: True positive predictions: 3035, True negative predictions: 208, False positive predictions: 352, and False negative predictions: 67. This was plotted within a confusion matrix for graphical visualizations. The prediction accuracy score of the model was 89% as shown in the classification report.</p>
										<img src="images/initialcm.png" alt="Initial Confusion Matrix">
										<img src="images/intialacc.jpg" alt="Initial Accuracy Score">
											<p>The optimized model was reduced via the backward stepwise elimination method. This reduction kept only the variables with p-values of less than 0.05. It reduced the variables from the initial model’s thirteen to eight key attributes.</p>
										<img src="images/optmizlogit.png" alt="Logit Optimized">
											<p>The same train_test_split ratio was utilized to provide an adequate comparison between the modeling. The optimized logistic regression score was slightly higher at 88.47%. The optimized model’s prediction results were summarized as follows: True positive predictions: 3035, True negative predictions: 205, False positive predictions: 355, and False negative predictions: 67. The prediction accuracy score was slightly lower at 88%.</p>
										<img src="images/optcm.png" alt="Optimized Confusion Matrix"><img src="images/optacc.jpg" alt="Optimized Accuracy Score">
										<p>Overall, the optimized modeling was deemed successful based on the z-statistics found within the logit summary along with the higher model score. The z-statistics of the optimized model provided a better statistical fit due to the strength of the predictors. A z-statistic value further from zero meant the stronger its role was as a predictor variable. These statistics were larger in the optimized model. For example: “PageValues” with a z-statistic value of “34.035” within the Optimized model, but “33.91” within the initial.</p>
											<li>Study Findings</li>
											<p><i>As noted previously, the optimized model's prediction accuracy score was 88%. This exceeds the evaluation metric threshold of 80%. It deemed the optimized model an effective logistic regression model. The second metric of success was the identification of attributes with statistical significance. This was noted by the eight explanatory variables with a p-value of less than 0.05. A further reduction to narrow the scope of contributing attributes was identified with the usage of z-statistics. All of these metrics were needed to successfully reject the null hypothesis.</i></p>
										<img src="images/studyfinding.png" alt="Study Findings">
										<li>Limitations</li>
											<p><i>The main limitations of this study were related to the time-period of the dataset. The data was limited to a one-year period. There was not a clear identification of what year was captured or even if this was a typical year in general. E-commerce has grown vastly in the past decade, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of specifics to the actual year captured within the data could restrict the resulting outcomes and attributes.
												<br/>Another limitation was some minor issues with the data. The data was noted as a one- year period to capture all the annual holidays. Unfortunately, the dataset was missing some key observations such as the sessions within January and April. This would lose data that could be provided by holiday sales in those months including after Christmas sales, New Year's, and Easter.
												</i></p>
											<li>Proposed Actions</li>
											<p><i>The key attributes could lead the e-commerce company to a few proposed actions. These actions could include the following:
												<br/>
												•	The investigation of contributions based on Page Values<br/>
												•	Identification of key features and page duration<br/>
												•	Various Sales/Retention discounts and advertisements.<br/>
												This could prompt analysis of those specific duration metrics and their strengths to help in marketing brainstorming. The marketing team could initiate further analyses on attributes and how a user’s page duration could contribute to sales. Sales and retention teams could increase retention and sales efforts via promos and targeted advertisements.
												</i></p>
											<li>Expected Benefits of Study</li>
											<p><i>The expected benefits of this logistic regression model could relate to the identification of key attributes for improved business strategies in various departments within the e-commerce company. As noted previously, this would provide various insights into which attributes would contribute to revenue occurring. For example, the marketing team would focus on strategies to increase revenue for low-performing pages based on their specific page values. Similarly, the sales team can focus attention on the high revenue months and revenue obtained during holidays to suggest seasonal and holiday pricing. Lastly, the customer retention team can provide targeted campaigns to increase customer retention of returning customers via promo codes and other discounting techniques.</i></p>

									<h2>Data Analysis on Coronavirus Global Impact</h2>
								</header>
										<p> Led a comprehensive exploratory analysis utilizing PostgreSQL to uncover the intricate facets of COVID-19's global impact. Leveraging advanced statistical techniques, I unearthed critical insights into infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination dynamics. Findings, including identifying peak infection years and assessing case proportions within the United States, showcase my ability to extract actionable intelligence from complex datasets. This was further expanded with the use of Tableau to visualize the key metrics for readability.
                                        </p>
									<p><b>Case Thesis:</b> How has the Coronavirus Pandemic affected the global population?</p>
									<p>The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant global impact, affecting nearly every country in the world. The virus has caused millions of deaths, disrupted economies, and changed the way we live our lives. There were multiple ways to evaluate the global impact based on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. All of these features were used in the exploratory analysis.<br/><br/>The following questions were investigated to provide key metrics.</p>
									<ul>
										<img src="images/caseannual.png" alt="Annual Infection Rate">
										<li>What year had the highest infection rate?</li>
											<p><i>We can see that 2022 leads the pack in overall infection cases. It had an overall total of over a billion new cases globally</i></p>
										<img src="images/infectionrate.png" alt="InfectionPercentage">
										<li>What was the percentage of total cases in the United States compared to the overall population?</li>
											<p><i>As of May 2023, the total cases were 30.57% of the total population in the United States. This was the equivalent of about 103 million cases.</i></p>
										<img src="images/deathvsvaccination.png" alt="Deaths vs Vaccinations">
										<img src="images/deathvsvaccination2.png" alt="Deaths ">
										<li>What location had the highest Death rate?</li>
											<p><i>Overall, the United States has the highest death count compared to other countries. It had the most cases and deaths, but not in vaccinations. The US trailed behind in vaccinations compared to other countries. For example, China had the most vaccinations, but the least number of deaths and cases. This could hint toward a correlation between the deaths and vaccinations.</i></p>
